--- DISH SERVING ---

Elf.LikedDish1 = In a few more hundred years, this establishment might really grow into something. Hm? Ah, my apologies; I forgot how long humans live. (+10 Affection)
Elf.LikedDish2 = Reminds me a lot of my mother’s cooking. She was a very disagreeable woman, but at least she knew how to whip up something tasty. Hopefully you won’t prove as obnoxious.
Elf.LikedDish3 = My father taught me two things in life; to speak up when something is wrong, and to never take no as an answer. Thankfully, I don’t need to exercise the first lesson today. Seconds, now.
Elf.LikedDish4 = An adequate meal, perhaps even fit for an Elf. Continue to serve food of this caliber and you will keep my patronage, [player].
Elf.LikedDish5 = This will stave me over until ‘morrow. Congratulations, [player].
Elf.NeutralDish = Your culinary experience is evident, [player], though I do wish you’d use a bit more oregano. Regardless, this will do. (+5 Affection)
Elf.DislikedDish1 = It will take a few centuries to forget this dreadful experience I had today. (-5 Affection)
Elf.DislikedDish2 = This defies all known rules of culinary science, [player]. In an extraordinarily negative manner.
Elf.BlindingStew = Is... is that an eyeball staring back at me? In spite of all my years of living, you truly have managed to craft something... unique, [player].
Elf.WrongDish1 = This wasn't on your menu today, but shall still scarcely suffice, I suppose. 
Elf.WrongDish2 = I did not request this of you, but appears appealing enough, I suppose.
Elf.Filler = What a… quaint abode you have, [player]! It’s very nice, for a human. A bit more help on the woodwork and this could be a serviceable little café.

Phrog.LikedDish1 = I’ve heard of this place from around the pond, I’m glad it’s as good as they say it is!
Phrog.LikedDish2 = Just the right amount of bug and slime! Thank you, [player]!
Phrog.NeutralDish = Could use a bit more bug bits, I think.
Phrog.DislikedDish1 = [player]! I said I wanted flies in my food!
Phrog.DislikedDish2 = Gurp?! (What... what *is* this?!)
Phrog.BlindingStew1 = Ahhh, what bitter spores! I can’t see straight! I love it!
Phrog.BlindingStew2 = Ah, a refreshing blinding stew — and you even gave me extra eyeballs! You've made my day, [player].
Phrog.Filler = Gurp! (Good afternoon, [player]! Today, I would like to eat...)

Satyr.DislikeddDish1 = Hmph. This is why you should've used some of *my* ingredients, [player].
Satyr.DislikedDish2 = I would've liked to spend the money I wasted on this dish elsewhere. 
Satyr.Filler = Ah, hello, [player]. Hopefully one of your dishes can satitate me before I have to hit the road again.


--- NPC FORAGING AREA ---

Elf.ForagingArea1 = Ah, [player]. Out gathering ingredients before this evening, hm? Humans' amount of perserverance can be quite commendable.
Elf.ForagingArea2 = I will never tire of the winds that blow through these lands. Me and... never mind, pay no heed to my musings. 
Satyr.ForagingArea1 = Heh, not to worry, [player]. I won’t take any of the ingredients you’re after. If you do happen to come up short, though, you can always buy them from me later.


--- AFFECTION EVENTS ---

Elf.RingReturn = ...I am unsure where you would ever find this, [player], but I am endlessly grateful it is back in my hands now. Thank you.
none.1_25 = (To get your attention, Asper lets out a shrill whistle, like the kind used to call a dog. The empty plate sat before her… clean. Only the glisten of leftovers on her cutlery suggested there was ever food at all, which she methodically begins licking clean .)
Elf.2_25 = Really, I’m surprised that someone like you was willing to try and open a restaurant this far out from your kin. Many upstart human chefs try their hardest but fail to appeal to a more nuanced palette afforded by an Elvish constitution.
Elf.3_25 = If that isn’t simple enough for your kind, it means your limited human palette could never impress an elf who is worth their salt.. like myself.
Player.4_25 = What do you mean “like you?”
Elf.5_25 = You know very well what I mean by like you. Or do I need to repeat myself to get it through your thick, human skull?
Elf.6_25 = Either way, it is surprising that you are capable of creating…edible foods. I had only ever been to the human realms once, and the cuisine was horrid. Except for when I ate with…
none.7_25 = (Asper’s eyes glazed over slightly as she thought of something else. A far-off memory? But the moment would pass so quickly that you almost doubted it happened. She’d shake her head and focus her gaze again, now refocusing her disdain towards you.)
Elf.8_25 = Whatever. You know, when you live as long as I do, all of you humans start to look the same. Perhaps if you continue to improve, you will be worth enough to exist as a footnote in my memory. Clean up my planes.
Player.9_25 = A simple “thank you” would suffice.
Elf.10_25 = No.
none.11_25 = (Asper would leave the door open behind her, letting the cold wind blow in from the outside. Asshole.)
