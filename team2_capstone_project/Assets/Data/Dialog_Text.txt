--- DISH SERVING ---

Elf.LikedDish1 = In a few more hundred years, this establishment might really grow into something. Hm? Ah, my apologies; I forgot how long humans live. (+10 Affection)
Elf.LikedDish2 = Reminds me a lot of my mother’s cooking. She was a very disagreeable woman, but at least she knew how to whip up something tasty. Hopefully you won’t prove as obnoxious.
Elf.LikedDish3 = My father taught me two things in life; to speak up when something is wrong, and to never take no as an answer. Thankfully, I don’t need to exercise the first lesson today. Seconds, now.
Elf.LikedDish4 = An adequate meal, perhaps even fit for an Elf. Continue to serve food of this caliber and you will keep my patronage, [player].
Elf.LikedDish5 = This will stave me over until ‘morrow. Congratulations, [player].
Elf.NeutralDish = Your culinary experience is evident, [player], though I do wish you’d use a bit more oregano. Regardless, this will do. (+5 Affection)
Elf.DislikedDish1 = It will take a few centuries to forget this dreadful experience I had today. (-5 Affection)
Elf.DislikedDish2 = This defies all known rules of culinary science, [player]. In an extraordinarily negative manner.
Elf.BlindingStew = Is... is that an eyeball staring back at me? In spite of all my years of living, you truly have managed to craft something... unique, [player].
Elf.WrongDish1 = This wasn't on your menu today, but shall still scarcely suffice, I suppose. 
Elf.WrongDish2 = I did not request this of you, but appears appealing enough, I suppose.
Elf.Filler = What a… quaint abode you have, [player]! It’s very nice, for a human. A bit more help on the woodwork and this could be a serviceable little café.

Phrog.LikedDish1 = I’ve heard of this place from around the pond, I’m glad it’s as good as they say it is!
Phrog.LikedDish2 = Just the right amount of bug and slime! Thank you, [player]!
Phrog.NeutralDish = Could use a bit more bug bits, I think.
Phrog.DislikedDish1 = [player]! I said I wanted flies in my food!
Phrog.DislikedDish2 = Gurp?! (What... what *is* this?!)
Phrog.BlindingStew1 = Ahhh, what bitter spores! I can’t see straight! I love it!
Phrog.BlindingStew2 = Ah, a refreshing blinding stew — and you even gave me extra eyeballs! You've made my day, [player].
Phrog.Filler = Gurp! (Good afternoon, [player]! Today, I would like to eat...)

Satyr.LikedDish1 = Tastes like a festival night — loud, lively, unforgettable. A delight, [player].
Satyr.LikedDish2 = Just what my hooves needed after a long trek. You cook with heart; I can tell.
Satyr.NeutralDish = Not bad at all. A little more spice and it would’ve sung. Still — I’ll eat it.
Satyr.DislikeddDish1 = Hmph. This is why you should've used some of *my* ingredients, [player].
Satyr.DislikedDish2 = I would've liked to spend the money I wasted on this dish elsewhere. 
Satyr.WrongDish1 = Not what I ordered, but… mm. I suppose I can make do.
Satyr.WrongDish2 = You’re lucky I like surprises almost as much as good food, [player].
Satyr.Filler = Ah, hello, [player]. Hopefully one of your dishes can satitate me before I have to hit the road again.

Minion.LikedDish1 = Oh! I wasn’t prepared for how good that was. My compliments… if that’s alright.
Minion.LikedDish2 = Oh... this is really wonderful, [player]. Better than I expected. Thank you.
Minion.NeutralDish = It’s good! Just… maybe a bit plain? Sorry, I didn’t mean that rudely.
Minion.DislikedDish2 = S-sorry, [player], but this one... doesn’t sit right with me.
Minion.WrongDish1 = Oh! I didn’t order this… but I can try it, if that helps.
Minion.WrongDish2 = Um... this isn’t what I asked for, but it looks okay… I think?
Minion.Filler = Hello... everything on your menu looks great!

Tanuki.LikedDish1 = The flavors settle nicely… like leaves drifting into a quiet pond. Quite comforting indeed.
Tanuki.NeutralDish = It’s pleasant enough. A little simple, perhaps… but simple isn’t bad.
Tanuki.DislikedDish1 = This one sits strangely on the tongue. Not to worry, [player]—learning is part of the process.
Tanuki.WrongDish1 = A different order, hm? Maybe I was meant to taste this one instead.
Tanuki.Filler = Your kitchen feels peaceful this evening. I think I’ll stay a bit.


--- NPC INTRODUCTIONS ---

Elf.Intro = Hello, human. My name is Asper Agis. Hopefully your cuisine can meet the standards necessitated by a High Elf.
Phrog.Intro = Hello, hello! I am one of many Phrogs in our family. I'm sure you'll meet the rest of us eventually!
Satyr.Intro = Ah, we meet again, [player]. I have high hopes that your dishes will satisfy, but I'm sure they will if you've been using my ingredients.
Minion.Intro = Oh! Hello… I’m Toto. I was told your cooking is… um… very good. I hope it’s alright if I try some?
Tanuki.Intro = Hello there. I’m Yozu. Your restaurant has a quiet warmth to it; fitting of an old tree hollow. I thought I’d step in and see what you’re cooking.


--- NPC FORAGING AREA ---

Elf.ForagingArea1 = Ah, [player]. Out gathering ingredients before this evening, hm? Humans' amount of perserverance can be quite commendable.
Elf.ForagingArea2 = I will never tire of the winds that blow through these lands. Me and... never mind, pay no heed to my musings. 
Satyr.ForagingArea1 = Heh, not to worry, [player]. I won’t take any of the ingredients you’re after. If you do happen to come up short, though, you can always buy them from me later.


--- INTRO SCENE EVENT ---

Chef.Start = It seems like fantasy to find this abandoned house and journal, but...
Chef.Start = I can feel that this is where I'm meant to be.
Chef.Start = Yeah! It really is the start of something new.
Chef.Start = A new life...
Chef.Start = A new leaf...
Chef.Start = Maybe even... a new love?


--- AFFECTION EVENTS ---

Elf.RingReturn = ...I am unsure where you would ever find this, [player], but I am endlessly grateful it is back in my hands now. Thank you.



--- Elf 25 Event ---

Default.1_25 = (To get your attention, Asper lets out a shrill whistle, like the kind used to call a dog. The empty plate sat before her… clean. Only the glisten of leftovers on her cutlery suggested there was ever food at all, which she methodically begins licking clean.)
Elf.2_25 = Really, I’m surprised that someone like you was willing to try and open a restaurant this far out from your kin. Many upstart human chefs try their hardest but fail to appeal to a more nuanced palette afforded by an Elvish constitution.
Elf.3_25 = If that isn’t simple enough for your kind, it means your limited human palette could never impress an elf who is worth their salt... like myself.
Chef.4_25 = What do you mean “like you?”
Elf.5_25 = You know very well what I mean by like you. Or do I need to repeat myself to get it through your thick, human skull?
Elf.6_25 = Either way, it is surprising that you are capable of creating… edible foods. I had only ever been to the human realms once, and the cuisine was horrid. Except for when I ate with…
Default.7_25 = (Asper’s eyes glazed over slightly as she thought of something else. A far-off memory? But the moment would pass so quickly that you almost doubted it happened. She’d shake her head and focus her gaze again, now refocusing her disdain towards you.)
Elf.8_25 = Whatever. You know, when you live as long as I do, all of you humans start to look the same. Perhaps if you continue to improve, you will be worth enough to exist as a footnote in my memory. Clean up my planes.
Chef.9_25 = A simple “thank you” would suffice.
Elf.10_25 = No.
Default.11_25 = (Asper would leave the door open behind her, letting the cold wind blow in from the outside. Asshole.)

--- Elf 50 Event ---

none.1_1_50 = (Asper would stare down at the food in front of her with disgust, as if she didn’t go through the effort to order something which was nearly impossible to construct without direct access to a human supermarket. The gall!)
Elf.1_2_50 = …I should have known that you worked at a McDragons. You definitely seem like the kind of person who would have spent a long time there. I haven’t walked into one for decades—but it still feels the same as it did all that time ago.
Elf.1_3_50 = Greasy. Turgid. Soft and hard in the wrong places. Ingredients chosen through convenience and cost rather than flavor or taste. Bundled together in a soggy, wet paper wrapper. It’s “food” constructed to fill a quota rather than a belly.
none.2_1_50 = (Despite what she was saying, her eyes would soften as she looked at the tower of monetized meat before her. She would slowly bring it up to her lips.)
none.3_1_50 = (A single bite. Small. Precise. Efficient. Even when eating a burger, Asper couldn’t escape treating it like some kind of royal ambrosia.)
none.4_1_50 = (She would lick her lips, savoring the taste. But it wasn't the burger she enjoyed; something stirred and swelled from the depths of her mind as she quickly inhaled and her eyes glittered with life.)
ElfBoyfriend.5_1_50 = I’m sorry I couldn’t afford something better. I’m sure you’ve had many more luxurious first dates, with how many other lovers you had. But I wanted to enjoy something I really like with you, and I hoped you might enjoy human cuisine. Even if it’s on the cheaper side of what we can offer.
Elf.5_1_50 = Don’t compare yourself to others like that! There’s a reason why I’m choosing to spend my time here with you now. Plus; this actually looks quite nice! Elvish food is always so dainty and unsatisfying to eat. It’s a good change of pace to eat something which might actually fill me up for once.
none.7_1_50 = (Asper’s eyes did something that you thought was biologically impossible a few moments before. Moisture accumulated at the edges of her eyes as she began to cry. It was the kind of weak, soundless suffering that came when something beautiful and beloved finally came to pass.)
none.7_2_50 = (The edges of her lips curled into a soft smile as she dragged her fingers across her face, wiping away the tears which began to find their way across her flushed cheeks.)
none.7_3_50 = (For some reason you have the urge to hand her a napkin, but refrain from doing so. Chances were she’d take it as an insult, and you didn’t want to ruin whatever epiphany she was going through.)
none.7_4_50 = (Asper would finish her meal with a methodic efficiency. Like she had lived through before, and was simply going through the motions. For some reason, you feel that she has replayed this moment in her head many, many times.)
none.7_5_50 = (Asper would silently rise from her seat and leave a bag of gold on the table, before departing. A sizable tip, which you suspect will be the first and last time you see such a thing from her.)


--- Elf 75 Event ---

Journal.RingFound = It’s a ring that is unmistakably Elvish!
Journal.RingFound = It is rare for elves to part with such a well-kept looking token.
Journal.RingFound = We should look around to see if anyone has lost it.
Elf.1_75 = Ah yes the human chef is out on their daily forage, taking all of nature’s resources just to disrespect them later. (She laughs) I am messing with you, but you still have a thing or two to learn before you can fully impress me.
Chef.2_75 = I found this on the ground. Would you happen to know anything about it? Its look... reminds me of you.
Elf.3_75 = ... Where did you get that? 
Chef.4_75 = It seemed important. 
Elf.5_75 = Hand that to me.
none.6_75 = (She takes the ring and examines it for a moment, brushing over the band)
Chef.7_75 = It’s surely Elven, right? It’s very distinct.
Elf.8_75 = It’s a ring that symbolizes a bond between two elves. Forming a pair who choose each other above time, family, faction. Elves only exchange them with those they plan to spend eternity with.
Chef.9_75 = So like marriage for humans I guess?
Elf.10_75 = Yes, but it's more serious than that. I do suppose humans call it marriage… which makes me such a fool that I gave one to a mortal like yourself. 
Chef.11_75 = Did it belong to someone you loved?
Elf.12_75 = I believed some things were worth defying ages of expectation for. Even though elves so disrespectfully defy the laws of time, it still punished me for it.
Elf.13_75 = Us Elves… we pay for memory.
none.14_75 = (She clenches the ring in her hand)
Elf.15_75 = Do not mistake this for weakness. 
Elf.16_75 = I refuse to mourn so weakly in front of you. So humanly.
none.17_75 = (She looks at you with tears in her eyes) 
Elf.18_75 = …Thank you, for returning it.  


--- Elf 100 Event ---

Elf.1_1_100 = So you know this place too.
Elf.1_2_100 = He always wanted to be buried somewhere quiet. 
Chef.1_3_100 = Sorry for intruding
Elf.2_1_100 = When I start to hear his voice too clearly. I visit every few decades or so, or whenever I am reminded of him. 
none.3_1_100 = (She places the ring on the stone it catches a ray of light)
Elf.4_1_100 = The cruelest part of an elf's lifespan is that eventually you outlive the grief too. I hate myself for it.
Elf.4_2_100 = Humans' short lifespan is merciful in a way, maybe it’s what makes me admire them.
none.4_3_100 = (Asper turns and smiles at the player)
Elf.4_4_100 = I don’t think I want to come here anymore. 
Elf.4_5_100 = Thank you for tolerating me, chef.
Elf.4_6_100 = You have reminded me that even centuries later, I can still feel full.


--- OBJECT INTERACTIONS ---

Default.Dresser = (Filled with clothes, including your old McDragons uniform. You should probably get rid of this.)
Default.ChalkBoard = (You could brainstorm lots of different recipes on this board!)
Default.Journal = (Your journal filled with cooking recipes you've taught yourself, ingredients you can find in the wild, and... a catalogue of your customers? Probably best not to show them.)

Default.ExitDoor = (Better not go back outside this late.)
