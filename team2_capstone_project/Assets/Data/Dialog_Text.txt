Other elf liked dish lines:
Reminds me a lot of my mother’s cooking. She was a very disagreeable woman, but at least she knew how to whip up something tasty. Hopefully you won’t prove as obnoxious.

My father taught me two things in life; to speak up when something is wrong, and to never take no as an answer. Thankfully I don’t need to exercise the first lesson today. Seconds, now.

An adequate meal, perhaps even fit for an Elf. Continue to serve food of this caliber and you will keep my patronage.

In a few more hundred years this establishment might really grow into something. Hm? Ah, my apologies; I forgot how long humans live.

This will stave me over until ‘morrow. Congratulations.
