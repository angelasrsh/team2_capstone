--- DISH SERVING ---

Elf.LikedDish1 = In a few more hundred years, this establishment might really grow into something. Hm? Ah, my apologies; I forgot how long humans live. (+10 Affection)
Elf.LikedDish2 = Reminds me a lot of my mother’s cooking. She was a very disagreeable woman, but at least she knew how to whip up something tasty. Hopefully you won’t prove as obnoxious.
Elf.LikedDish3 = My father taught me two things in life; to speak up when something is wrong, and to never take no as an answer. Thankfully, I don’t need to exercise the first lesson today. Seconds, now.
Elf.LikedDish4 = An adequate meal, perhaps even fit for an Elf. Continue to serve food of this caliber and you will keep my patronage, [player].
Elf.LikedDish5 = This will stave me over until ‘morrow. Congratulations, [player].
Elf.NeutralDish = Your culinary experience is evident, [player], though I do wish you’d use a bit more oregano. Regardless, this will do. (+5 Affection)

Elf.Filler = What a… quaint abode you have, [player]! It’s very nice, for a human. A bit more help on the woodwork and it could be a serviceable little cafe.

Phrog.LikedDish = I’ve heard of this place from around the pond, I’m glad it’s as good as they say it is!
Phrog.NeutralDish = Could use a bit more bug bits, I think.
Phrog.DislikedDish1 = [player]! I said I wanted flies in my food!
Phrog.DislikedDish2 = Gurp?! (Good heavens, did you drop this in the swamp?!)
Phrog.DislikedDish3 = Gurp?! (What... what *is* this?!)
Phrog.BlindingStew1 = Ahhh, what bitter spores! I can’t see straight! I love it!

Phrog.Filler = Gurp! (Good afternoon, [player]! Today, I would like to eat...)

Satyr.DislikeddDish1 = Bold choice, [player]. Terrible execution.
