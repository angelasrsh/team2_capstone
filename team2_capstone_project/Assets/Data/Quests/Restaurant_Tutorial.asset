  - Welcome back to our humble cafe! When customers arrive, press "R" near them to
    take their order and "R" again to finish.
  - Let's look at the stew recipe by clicking on the tile in the Recipe journal tab.
  - Looking at the recipe, we'll need to chop and boil ingredients to prepare them.
    Close the journal and head to the chopping board!
  - You can check the recipe here too to check what you'll need to cut!
  - Now drag and cut one fogshroom and one eye. Press back when you're done!
  - Great! Now let's do the cauldron work. Walk over and press "E!"
  - Put in water, add your bone, and stir until the broth is ready.
  - Now combine the broth, fogshroom, and eye  and stir to make your dish!
  - Looks great! Exit when you're done.
  - Now that you have a dish, you can serve it to your customers with "R". Hopefully
    they like it!
  - Perfect! That's all for today's playtest. Thank you for cooking with me!
