  - Welcome back to our humble cafe! When customers arrive, interact with them to
    take their order.
  - Look at the journal- we need to chop and cook ingredients to prepare them. Head
    to the chopping board and press "E" to use it!
  - One more to go! Let's chop the other ingredient now.
  - Now it's time to cook! Head to the cauldron next to make bone broth, then the
    stew.
  - Now that you have a dish, you can serve it to your customers with "R". Hopefully
    they like it!
  - Perfect! If you have ingredients, you can keep cooking until you run out.
